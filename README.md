## How UniFlow fits into a university ecosystem

Most universities operate with multiple disconnected systems:
- An admissions portal  
- A student information system  
- A finance system  
- A learning management system  
- Reporting and compliance tools  

UniFlow acts as the system of record that connects them. It:
- Stores the authoritative student profile  
- Tracks academic progress across terms  
- Syncs data with external platforms via APIs  
- Maintains audit trails for compliance and reporting
